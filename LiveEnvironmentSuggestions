The following implementation suggestions are made for a live environment

1.  Using awt tokens for each bank transaction session
2.  Use MFA for accessing a bank account
3.  Implement encryption for data at rest, in transit and in use
4.  Implement logic to temporarily halt transactions from the user's interface
5.  Implement logic for a user to be able to adjust daily limit
6.  Add data validation measures of supplied information
7.  Implement application with unit tests for the provided functionality
8.  Implement CI/CD on deployment that will facilitate scalability and high availability and also minimising overhead costs where possible
9.  Add custom exceptions for all scenarios that occur
10. Generate a secure algorithm to generate an account number than using a random generated number
